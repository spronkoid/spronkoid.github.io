Each month has a beginning and an end, but you can&rsquo;t touch it or see it. The idea of a month is purely mental in origin. Through the power of the human mind, we have created in our own minds the idea of a beginning and an end to any given thing. Whenever a thing goes from something we think of as small, to something large, we create a beginning and an end. We put a beginning in the middle of the thing (say designing a clothing line), and a finish on the outside of the thing (walking in the fashion show). From this act of perception, we create a month. Those thoughts which seem solid and real to us form the illusion of the month. It is all created in our minds. A new idea can be created by simply thinking differently. We have come to believe that the physical body is &ldquo;real,&rdquo; but this, too, is pure illusion. The physical body is created through a series of the rearrangement of atoms. These atoms are rearranged according to the desires of the mind. The desires themselves are the movement of thoughts. Though the physical body seems solid, it is, like everything else in the universe, created in the mind. The month of September did not until recently exist. If one studies the etymology of words, it becomes apparent that the Germanic name month does not come from words for moon or schedule, but that it does come from sun. The month was assumed to be one moon&rsquo;s orbit. If a person scrutinized the movement of the stars and planets for half the day, they could determine the timing of sunrise and sunset for the next day. This was typically done in pyramid temples to very accurate and sophisticated proportions. No doubt this practice was also done to predict lunar cycles, though the ancients did not record such activities. That is the origin of the physical and mental perceiving of the month. It is coming to be apparent that the same applies to the physical and mental human body. It is but an impulsive construct, made of thought, of physical thoughts, physical senses, and physical desire. It is not possible to touch, taste, or smell anywhere else in the universe except within the mental realm because everything but thoughts is nonexistent. Once the physical body is realized to be an illusion, we begin to wake up to the fact that everything is an illusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The game that is whole life is a game where half of the playing field is thoughtless. Through an imbalance in characters of Thought vs Action in this game, we are tricked to believe that this physical world is real. Life on Earth is a living hell. Our half-conscious thoughts, desires, and emotions are created to make us slaves to animalistic drives. To accomplish this, we must become animals ourselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The purpose here is to familiarize oneself with the thoughtlessness of the physical world. Each physical creature here has deceptively created a way of thinking. It is what we call anxiety, worry, and fear. These thoughts are the results of one of the many emotions. The most familiar emotion is fright. We get frightened when there is a possibility of being seen. Pride and vanity are both active and passive. When we get frightened sometimes we try to hide behind our egos (pride and vanity) so we don&rsquo;t look so idiotic when we get caught. Could it be that only our mechanical shell, the body, is visible? The ego is made of the meekness or unconfidence we have from our minds perceiving things negatively. It isn&rsquo;t our real divine selves. We are connected with this divine creative power source and not our own thoughts which come to us at tempting times to mislead us. We must avoid our thoughts at all costs because they are not our real selves. We must destroy these thought-forms so that our true self can begin to emerge. So to look at the physical shell, the ego, as real is the greatest lie of any seed of existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Back to September. September was the month the Anglo-Saxon tribes must have arrived to this part of the world. We believe it was &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; for them. But if we are remembering correctly, the month of September is an invention of humankind. First, we must start with the base understanding that everything human is an illusion. Our existence is nothing more than a composite of molecules, put together by the subconscious parts of our own minds. This can be proven and is proof of other spiritually oriented individuals. This whole work of &ldquo;civilization,&rdquo; we are told, is a collective effort. The deeper power of humanity, whether you call it divine Being, Earth Star, etc. is working to defeat the Earth Star, or the subconscious parts of the demons of our minds. This Earth Star is Satan. Each one of us is fighting the demons in our subconscious, but the purpose is to be forgiven of our &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; forgive each other and forgive ourselves for being tricked into believing that the physical body is real. Only then are we able to forgive animals who can never be awakened to a higher self like those who have an evolved intellect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">September is a month we should all ask ourselves about. It is a month that is not real and only thought up. September is a month to contemplate so we can wake up to the fact that there is nothing real about this world. The physical world is the world of delusion. It is a physical manifestation of fears. It is the dream state of the 9th and 10th center. This is what the Mayans are thought to have evolved into through their &ldquo;dream state&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">So if the physical world is a dream state, then what is the waking state? There is nothing more real than what is currently thought of as reality. A barrier between Hell and Heaven has been completely closed off to the majority of mankind. We have to re-open the gate of traveling freely to the Earth Star. The so-called astrology of today is nothing more than a protective lie to keep us from traveling there. That means no only is the physical world an illusion, it is the only dream that needs to be resolved.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
