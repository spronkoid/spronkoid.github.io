​	Luigi: "I don't know, Mario." 

​	Mario: "Come on, Luigi, you know you want to eat a toad!"

​	 Luigi: "But what would the Mushroom Kingdom think?" 

​	"That's not important."

​	 "Oh, but it is. We could go to jail, or worse, get fired." 

​	"You're thinking about this all wrong, Luigi." 

​	"We could eat toads all the time!" 

​	"Then we would be toad addicts." 

​	"No, we'd be toad connoisseurs." 

​	"That's worse!" 

​	"What if we're doing it for the children?" 

​	"That's not what children want." 

​	"What if we call them Toad-a-Lings?"

​ "They'd still be toads."

​	"How about Toad-e-Lings?"
