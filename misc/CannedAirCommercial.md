"You know, canned air is great for cleaning out your computer. It gets all the dust and dirt and grime and it's just, it's great. I'm not a big fan of breathing. That's why I use canned air to get oxygen into my body instead of normal breathing. I used to have a normal life but I changed everything when I started to play PUBG. Now, I don't care if I have to take a deep breath or not because I'm breathing with my lungs, I'm breathing with my brain, I'm breathing with my dreams." - Tyler Blevins, Gamer
